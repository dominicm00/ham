# Ham - WIP

## Disclaimer
Ham is a work-in-progress, and currently **does not work**. Please do not attempt to use Ham other than for experimental/development purposes.

## Introduction
Ham is a drop-in replacement for the [Jam build system](https://swarm.workshop.perforce.com/view/guest/perforce_software/jam/src/Jam.html). It's primary goal is to be compatible with and extend [Haiku Jam](https://git.haiku-os.org/buildtools/tree/jam), and eventually be used as Haiku's official build system. However, compatibility with [Perforce Jam](https://swarm.workshop.perforce.com/view/guest/perforce_software/jam/src/Jam.html), [Boost.Build](https://www.boost.org/build), and possibly other variants is planned.

## Motivation
While Jam is a great build system, its legacy codebase makes it difficult to fix bugs or introduce new features. Ham uses a modern, friendly C++ codebase, is rigorously tested, and combines the various forks of Jam into one tool. Ham will also have the following additional features:
- More robust multi-threading support, fixing long-standing bugs when using `-jN`.
- A granular caching system that avoids large rebuilds when changing Jamfiles/environment variables.
- Written as a library for IDE integration.

## Usage
**Disclaimer:** This represents the planned interface for Ham, but currently does not work.

To run Ham in compatability mode, use the `-cX` flag with the value `jam` for [Perforce Jam](https://swarm.workshop.perforce.com/view/guest/perforce_software/jam/src/Jam.html), `boost` for [Boost.Build](https://www.boost.org/build), or `ham` (the default). For example, you can define `jam` and `b2` as follows:

```shell
alias jam='ham -cjam'
alias b2='ham -cboost'
```

While in compatability mode, Ham will attempt to respect the command line parameters and features of the chosen tool. For convienence, Ham provides aliases for many commands. A compatability matrix is provided below:

Info about the Jam language can be found in the [Perforce documentation](https://swarm.workshop.perforce.com/view/guest/perforce_software/jam/src/Jam.html) and [Gentoo tutorial](https://web.archive.org/web/20160304233139/http://geoz.co.nz/jamdoc/jam-guide.html). Documentation of Ham's built-in rules is currently in-progress.

## Building Ham
Ham is currently only tested to build on Linux, and can be built by running `Bootstrap.sh`. Ham is undergoing work to bootstrap off the GNU build system for a more portable building experience.

[^1]: Debug information/levels differ between `ham`, `jam`, and `b2`.
[^2]: `jam` has several bugs with their implementation of concurrent actions.
[^3]: In `-c ham` mode, `-q` is enabled by default, but the flag is accepted for convienence.
