# Ham - WIP {#index}

## Disclaimer
Ham is a work-in-progress, and currently **does not work**. Please do not attempt to use Ham other than for
experimental/development purposes.

## Introduction
Ham is a drop-in replacement for the [Jam build
system](https://swarm.workshop.perforce.com/view/guest/perforce_software/jam/src/Jam.html). It's primary goal is to be
compatible with and extend [Haiku Jam](https://git.haiku-os.org/buildtools/tree/jam), and eventually be used as Haiku's
official build system. However, compatibility with [Perforce
Jam](https://swarm.workshop.perforce.com/view/guest/perforce_software/jam/src/Jam.html),
[Boost.Build](https://www.boost.org/build), and possibly other variants is planned.

## Motivation
While Jam is a great build system, its legacy codebase makes it difficult to fix bugs or introduce new features. Ham
uses a modern, friendly C++ codebase, is rigorously tested, and combines the various forks of Jam into one tool. Ham
will also have additional features such as:
- More robust multi-threading support, fixing long-standing bugs when using `-jN`.
- A granular caching system that avoids large rebuilds when changing Jamfiles/environment variables.
- Written as a library for IDE integration.

## Usage
**Disclaimer:** This represents the planned interface for Ham, but currently does not work.

To run Ham in compatability mode, use the `-cX` flag with the value `jam` for [Perforce
Jam](https://swarm.workshop.perforce.com/view/guest/perforce_software/jam/src/Jam.html), `boost` for
[Boost.Build](https://www.boost.org/build), or `ham` (the default). For example, you can define `jam` and `b2` as
follows:

```sh
alias jam='ham -cjam'
alias b2='ham -cboost'
```

While in compatibility mode, Ham will attempt to respect the command line parameters and features of the chosen
tool. For convienence, Ham provides aliases for many commands. A compatability matrix is provided below:

Info about the Jam language can be found in the [Perforce
documentation](https://swarm.workshop.perforce.com/view/guest/perforce_software/jam/src/Jam.html) and the (archived)
[Gentoo tutorial](https://web.archive.org/web/20160304233139/http://geoz.co.nz/jamdoc/jam-guide.html). Documentation of
Ham's built-in rules is currently in-progress.

## Building Ham
Ham is built using
[Autotools](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Autotools-Introduction.html). Currently no
distribution tarballs are available, so Ham must be built from the repository source code.

To build Ham from this repository, the following dependencies are required:
- [Autoconf](https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/)
- [Automake](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/)
- [Libtool](https://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/)
- A C++ compiler with support for C++20

**NOTE:** Ham plans to take the following dependencies in the near future:
- [Flex](https://github.com/westes/flex) (not required with distribution tarball)
- [Bison](https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/) (not required with distribution tarball)

To build Ham from the repository source code, initialize the Automake system and then run the standard `./configure &&
make`.

```sh
autoreconf --install
./configure
# Add -jN (where N is the number of parallel CPUs on your system) for faster builds
make
```

You can then run `make install` to install Ham on your system.

[^1]: Debug information/levels differ between `ham`, `jam`, and `b2`.
[^2]: `jam` has several bugs with their implementation of concurrent actions.
[^3]: In `-cham` mode, `-q` is enabled by default, but the flag is accepted for
    convienence.
